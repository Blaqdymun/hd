Out-of-the-way transparent WinterBoard theme that lets you really
showcase your wallpaper. Glasklart is swedish, it means "clear as
glass".

Now includes 6100+ icons which have been graciously crafted by the community.

Compatible **only** with iOS7 since the [release](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/releases) of [Version 4.0.0](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/releases/tag/release%2Fv4.00.0).
